                    <h3>Analyzing the Performance of Sentiment Analysis using BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa and GPT-2</h3>
                    <p id="authors"> <strong>Sakib Imtiaz,</strong> Emrana Kabir Hashi, and Md. Al Mehedi Hasan.</p>
                    <p>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a key focus of our research in the field of natural language processing. Our project employs a deep learning approach using four advanced transformer-based models: BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, to analyze sentiments in textual data. Traditional sentiment analysis techniques often rely on linear methods such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which may not fully capture complex emotional expressions in text. Our approach is the first to assess and compare the non-linear capabilities of these models on the Sentiment140 dataset, highlighting the exceptional accuracy of the GPT-2 model at 94.13%. This model significantly outperforms others by effectively capturing and analyzing the nuances of sentiment, offering a more robust and nuanced understanding of text-based emotional expressions. This research not only advances the field of natural language processing but also sets a new benchmark for sentiment analysis techniques.</p>

                    <p id="authors"> Debashis Gupta, Aditi Golder, <strong>Sakib Imtiaz,</strong> Greg Larsen, Miles Silman, Luis Fernandez, Sarra Alqahtani, Fan Yang, Robert Plemmons, and V. Pa√∫l Pauca.</p>
                    <p>This study delves into the socioeconomic impacts of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) on local communities in various developing countries. The project employed a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from environmental science, economics, and social studies, to assess how ASGM influences economic development, labor markets, and social dynamics within these regions. Utilizing both qualitative interviews and quantitative data analysis, the research team gathered comprehensive data from multiple mining communities. The results indicate that while ASGM contributes significantly to local economies by providing employment opportunities and stimulating economic activities, it also poses substantial challenges such as labor exploitation, social inequality, and adverse health effects. The project culminated in the development of a series of policy recommendations aimed at optimizing the benefits while mitigating the negative impacts of ASGM. These recommendations have been shared with relevant stakeholders, including local government bodies and international organizations, to foster sustainable practices and improve the livelihoods of those involved in ASGM.</p>

                    <h3>Conversational Agent for Therapy Assistance</h3>
                    <p>Mental health is a critical issue, with over 50,000 deaths attributed to suicide annually in the USA alone. While awareness of mental health concerns is increasing, many individuals remain reluctant to seek professional help, possibly due to cost considerations or societal stigma. Our objective is to develop an intermediary chatbot designed to support individuals by providing therapeutic assistance and assessing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and potential suicidal tendencies through conversational sessions. While this technology does not aim to replace the human element of therapy, it seeks to make a meaningful contribution to providing genuine medical care.</p>

                    <h3>DNA Sequence Classification</h3>
                    <p>This project involves the development and application of computational methods to categorize DNA sequences into predefined classes based on their nucleotide composition and sequence patterns. This field intersects biology, computer science, and statistics, leveraging techniques from machine learning, data mining, and bioinformatics to analyze and interpret vast amounts of genetic data. The classification of DNA sequences is crucial for various biological and medical applications, including identifying gene functions, discovering new biomarkers, and understanding evolutionary relationships. Advances in this area are particularly important for personalized medicine, where genetic information can guide treatment decisions and predict disease susceptibility. Researchers in this domain focus on improving the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of classification algorithms to handle the complexity and diversity of genetic data.</p>

                    <h3>Image Classification of Healthy and Spoiled Fruits and Vegetables</h3>
                     <p>This project focuses on developing and utilizing machine learning algorithms to automatically differentiate between healthy and spoiled produce based on visual data. This area of study typically involves gathering large datasets of fruit and vegetable images, which are then used to train deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The objective is to enable these models to accurately identify and classify the condition of fruits and vegetables from images. This technology can be particularly valuable in the agricultural sector, food retail, and quality control environments, where rapid and accurate assessment can lead to more efficient inventory management, reduced food waste, and enhanced consumer safety. The research not only explores algorithmic improvements and performance evaluation but also considers practical deployment challenges in real-world settings.</p>
