                    <h3>Analyzing the Performance of Sentiment Analysis using BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa and GPT-2</h3>
                    <p id="authors"> <strong>Sakib Imtiaz,</strong> Md. Al Mehedi Hasan, and Emrana Kabir Hashi.</p>
                    <p>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a key focus of our research in the field of natural language processing. Our project employs a deep learning approach using four advanced transformer-based models: BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, to analyze sentiments in textual data. Traditional sentiment analysis techniques often rely on linear methods such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which may not fully capture complex emotional expressions in text. Our approach is the first to assess and compare the non-linear capabilities of these models on the Sentiment140 dataset, highlighting the exceptional accuracy of the GPT-2 model at 94.13%. This model significantly outperforms others by effectively capturing and analyzing the nuances of sentiment, offering a more robust and nuanced understanding of text-based emotional expressions. This research not only advances the field of natural language processing but also sets a new benchmark for sentiment analysis techniques.</p>

                    <p id="authors"> Debashis Gupta, Aditi Golder, <strong>Sakib Imtiaz,</strong> Greg Larsen, Miles Silman, Luis Fernandez, Sarra Alqahtani, Fan Yang, Robert Plemmons, and V. Pa√∫l Pauca.</p>
                    <p>This study delves into the socioeconomic impacts of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) on local communities in various developing countries. The project employed a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from environmental science, economics, and social studies, to assess how ASGM influences economic development, labor markets, and social dynamics within these regions. Utilizing both qualitative interviews and quantitative data analysis, the research team gathered comprehensive data from multiple mining communities. The results indicate that while ASGM contributes significantly to local economies by providing employment opportunities and stimulating economic activities, it also poses substantial challenges such as labor exploitation, social inequality, and adverse health effects. The project culminated in the development of a series of policy recommendations aimed at optimizing the benefits while mitigating the negative impacts of ASGM. These recommendations have been shared with relevant stakeholders, including local government bodies and international organizations, to foster sustainable practices and improve the livelihoods of those involved in ASGM.</p>

                    <h3>Conversational Agent for Therapy Assistance</h3>
                    <p>Mental health is a critical issue, with over 50,000 deaths attributed to suicide annually in the USA alone. While awareness of mental health concerns is increasing, many individuals remain reluctant to seek professional help, possibly due to cost considerations or societal stigma. Our objective is to develop an intermediary chatbot designed to support individuals by providing therapeutic assistance and assessing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and potential suicidal tendencies through conversational sessions. While this technology does not aim to replace the human element of therapy, it seeks to make a meaningful contribution to providing genuine medical care.</p>
