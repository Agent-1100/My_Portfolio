                Hello, I'm Sakib Imtiaz, a dedicated and innovative Computer Science & Engineering graduate from Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Holding a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I specialized in large language models during a transformative period for artificial intelligence, aligning my studies with cutting-edge technological trends.
    
                Throughout my academic career, I engaged deeply with machine learning and deep learning technologies, culminating in the solo design of a 32-bit processor in simulationâ€”a project that honed my technical and problem-solving skills. My commitment extended beyond the classroom through active participation in coding festivals and community-oriented projects like environmental clean-ups, demonstrating my leadership and community spirit.
                
                Driven by a profound respect for education, inherited from my parents who are both teachers, my ultimate ambition is to become a professional researcher. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the technological advancement of Bangladesh. I am known for my ability to manage time effectively, generate innovative ideas, and maintain unwavering dedication to my goals.
                
                As I embark on this professional journey, I am eager to apply my skills in a dynamic environment, aiming to make significant contributions to research that uplifts my community and country.
